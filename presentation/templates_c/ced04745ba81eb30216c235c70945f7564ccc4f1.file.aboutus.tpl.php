					<p>
						All around New York City, there are walks to support the fight against cancer and Alzheimer's, heart disease and diabetes. 
						But in all these walks for the cure, there's something missing â€“ the fact that our ability to be healthy is dependent on more 
						than just access to the best medical care, it is dependent on our environment - the land we live on, the air we breathe and the 
						water we drink. If we don't take care of these most precious resources, we are not taking care of ourselves.
					</p>
					<p>
						Around the world, there are many towns and cities where there is no access to clean drinking water. Here in New York, we have been blessed 
						with an abundance of fresh water. Rivers, lakes and creeks help draw the landscape of our city and state, and we have some of the best drinking 
						water in the world. However, some of our waterways have been put in peril by bad accidents and bad practice. An oil spill in Brooklyn over 50 years 
						ago pollutes the land and water to this day. Radioactive water leaking out of the Indian Point power plant poisons sections of the Hudson River on 
						a daily basis. And our governor is allowing fracking wastewater from Pennsylvania to be dumped in New York, which puts poisons in our land and water.
					</p>
					<p>
						It is time for a walk in our great city to support a resource we depend on ever day to keep us healthy. It is time to Walk for Our Water!!!
